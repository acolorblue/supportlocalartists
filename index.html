      <p class='italic'>Question: Why not support smaller local artists instead of art that's already popular?</p>
      
<p>This was a question received after the preview of our 3D art gallery which I believed was a fair question.</p>

<p>First of all I do want to be clear, with all due respect to Noah, I believe this is false. This was never about "famous" artists. This is about the ultimate synthesis of great things and in that context, fame or popularity is not the best measure as some of my favorite artists such as Gregory Crewdson, Jeff Wall, Charlie White(photographer) & Aoife McArdle aren't as "popular". A good 95% of all short films that have been featured on acolorblue were either from film students, or emerging artists, some working in multiple mediums & some more known than others.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think it's important to lay the foundation down for the future. We want to be able to give emerging artists, specifically innovators, a huge boost in career and recognition wise, like a launching pad for incredible work. Almost like using a megaphone to the world and saying "This person is really goddamn important and I need every single one of you to pay attention right now". Let's use Sundance Film Festival as an example. Sundance is known for having really wonderful films annually, some of my favorites including Whiplash(2014), Reservoir Dogs(1992), Boyhood(2014). Tarantino got a break through after his premier of Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, Wes Anderson got a break through in 1993 after premiering his 13 minute short film 'Bottle Rocket'.</p>

<p>These artists were already wonderful before their premiers at Sundance, so it's not as if they all of a sudden became talented after the showing, the only thing that changed was the kind of audience that got to see their work. The only problem with institutions like this is that often times there are too many politics involved to get in, "Did this person do this? Did they graduate from this school? Did they do this internship? Did they get half their financing from such and such?" Who gives a fuck. All that matters is "Is this fucking beautiful?". We want to take that broke ass creative kid in his room working his ass off and show them to the world. This is something we want to do. We want to take the audience that loves Tarantino, Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, Kubrick, Spielberg, Spike Jonze, and put them in front of Aoife McArdle, Evan Ari Kelman & Kibwe Tavares films. To take the audience that loves Matisse, Twombly, Richard Serra, Kehinde Wiley, Rothko, David Altmejd, Damien Hirst and put them in front of a Zach Thompson, Spencer McMullen, Tyler Mitchell, Trystan Cullinan or whatever artists 40 years from now that'll be innovative. To say "this person is important and deserves just as much recognition". With this approach & strategy, it's important to have that audience first.</p>

<p>It's important to say this isn't the whole concept of ACOLORBLUE and what is trying to be accomplished as a whole, but in regard to this question specifically, this is our approach, this is what we believe can and should be done.</p>


<p>With Love,
   ACOLORBLUE.</p>
